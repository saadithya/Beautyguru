            <h3>Camera Access</h3>
            <p>The app requires camera access to capture facial images for analysis. Photos are processed locally on your device and are not stored on external servers. Images are used solely for the purpose of facial analysis and are deleted after processing unless you choose to save the scan results.</p>

            <h3>Storage Access</h3>
            <p>The app uses device storage to save your scan results and analysis data. This allows you to track your progress over time and review previous scans.</p>

            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>All facial images and personal data remain on your device. We do not collect, store, or transmit your photos to any external servers. Your privacy is our top priority.</p>
